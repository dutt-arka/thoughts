## Welcome my scribblings.

This is my informal blog on github pages,where I scribble down my thoughts,ideas and occasional notes w

### Markdown

This repository (will eventually) contain hosts of code,links and documents related to my personal learning in RL and ML.

As of now, I'll be focussing on providing the code here, that's the basic premise of what I did.

For the time being, here's a list of wonderful sources of resources for RL.

*A huge list of resources for R/L and Q-LEARNING.* (Will update more later lol)
